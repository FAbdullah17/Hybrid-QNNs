# Hybrid-QNNs

Hybrid-QNNs is a collaborative research project focused on hybrid quantum-classical neural networks. The goal is to study optimization challenges, such as barren plateaus, and provide practical insights for quantum algorithm design.

## Project Structure

- `src/`: Source code for classical and quantum models, utilities, and metrics.
- `experiments/`: Scripts for running experiments with different entanglement configurations.
- `configs/`: YAML configuration files for experiment parameters.
- `results/`: Directory for saving experiment outputs, plots, and metrics.
- `colab_template.ipynb`: Notebook for running and analyzing experiments in Google Colab.
- `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies.
- `README.md`: Project documentation.

## Workflow

1. Develop and test code locally.
2. Push changes to the GitHub repository.
3. Load the project in Google Colab for training and analysis.
4. Save results, plots, and metrics back to the repository for sharing and review.
5. Each team member experiments with different parameters for faster and more effective results.

## Team Coordination

- Use GitHub Issues for tracking bugs and feature requests: [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/FAbdullah17/Hybrid-QNNs/issues)
- Communicate regularly and update progress in meetings.

## Contribution

Contributions are welcome. Please follow best practices for code style and documentation. For questions or issues, contact the project maintainers.

## Research Impact

This project contributes to the understanding of quantum machine learning optimization and supports reproducible research for quantum algorithm development.
