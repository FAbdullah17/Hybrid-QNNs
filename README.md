# Quantum Machine Learning: Barren Plateaus Analysis with FashionMNIST

## Team
- Asma Zubair
- Farhan Riaz
- Fahad Abdullah

## Goals
- Investigate barren plateaus in quantum neural networks
- Compare entanglement strategies
- Analyze accuracy, gradient norms, entanglement entropy, convergence

## Structure
- Modular code in `src/`
- Experiments in `experiments/`
- Configs in `configs/`
- Results and plots in `results/`
- W&B logging for all metrics

## Usage
- Run experiments from `experiments/`
- Results saved in `results/` and W&B dashboard
